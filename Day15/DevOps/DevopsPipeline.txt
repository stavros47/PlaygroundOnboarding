DevOps Pipeline:
----------------

We are going to create a chain of Jenkins jobs to create DevOps pipeline.

1. Jenkins Job 1 - Will build a Custom Docker image with a Dockerfile.
2. Jenkins Job 2 - Will build a Maven based Java project inside a docker container
		   that was provisioned on the fly at runtime with the Docker image
		   that was build by Jenkins job 1.

Whenever we commit source code into the GitHub repository, job 1 will detect the code change and will trigger the docker image build automatically.

Once Jenkins Job 1 builds successfully it will trigger Jenkins Job 2.

This exercise will help us understand the below concepts:
	1. Jenkins DevOps Pipeline
	2. Jenkins Master/slave Mode.
	3. Docker Jenkins plugin.
