We would like to store employee and their address details in a table.

Single Table ( Employee )
	0. Employee ID ( Primary Key )
	1. Firstname
	2. Lastname
	3. Date Of Joining
	4. Designation
	5. Department
	6. Date of Birth
	
	7. Door No
	8. Street
	9. City
	10.Country
	11.Zipcode 

Primary Key - is a field/attribute that helps retrieving a unique record out of the table
	    - every employee will have a unique employee id
	    - primary key is a mandatory field for every employee record
	    - typically primary key can't be null or empty

	1. Address ID  ( Primary Key )	int
	2. Door No	VARCHAR(5)
	3. Street	VARCHAR(50)
	4. City		VARCHAR(100)
	5.Country	VARCHAR(100)
	6.Zipcode 	VARCHAR(10)
